## 📚 Notebooks Overview

- **ANN_CNN_CIFAR10_MNIST.ipynb**  
  Combines ANN and CNN architectures to classify datasets like CIFAR-10 and MNIST.

- **ANN_CreditScore.ipynb**  
  Uses a fully connected neural network to predict credit scores based on financial data.

- **ANN_From_Scratch.ipynb**  
  Demonstrates the core mechanics of an ANN by implementing it manually using NumPy.

- **ImageSegmentationChestCT_Pe.ipynb**  
  Applies image segmentation techniques to chest CT scans, potentially for medical diagnosis.

- **RNN(LSTM_CONVLSTM)_Mnist.ipynb**  
  Implements both LSTM and ConvLSTM models for sequential image processing on the MNIST dataset.
